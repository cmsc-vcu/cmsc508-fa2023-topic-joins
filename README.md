# CMSC 508 - SQL Joins workbook

This repository contains files that serve as explorations
of SQL joins.  The document is an empty template and the instructor will
complete the workbook in class, introducing both the topic of Joins AND offering
examples of how the tools work together.

## Installing and running the project

The *.src* folder contains the individual helper/tutorials.

- The *.qmd* files are rendered using quarto.

- The *.sql* files are intended to be opened in VSC and executed block-by-block.

## How to use this project

I suggest that you download this repo, install the necessary tools, and complete the exercises.

## Suggestions welcome!

Let me know if there are additional modules you'd like created.
